Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* The password for encrypting and decrypting credentials is stored in Odoo as a system parameter. An attacker who has the 'Administration/Settings' priviledge or has access to the Odoo database itself can easily decrypt a credential's password field.
* To Do: store the encryption password in Odoo's configuration file instead of a system parameter in the database
